# GeoIP
MJB Code's way of converting IP addresses to geo location data

This project is pending migration and cleanup for public use

- Sick of having to rely on a third-party API to convert your IP addresses into location information. Then realizing why your site doesn't load because their API is slow or goes down?
- Just host your own!

### Features
- Built with MaxMind DB
- Designed to auto update every 2 weeks
- Grabs all information that all the other API's grab, including more!
- Future build to be able to track all API calls to see who is using the API!
